        "Usage: Customer feedback comments are typically unstructured text data containing opinions, suggestions, complaints, and sentiments expressed by customers. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to analyze and extract insights from the text data. Sentiment analysis can be used to gauge overall customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Topic modeling can categorize feedback into themes or topics, allowing the company to prioritize and address customer concerns effectively.

        "Usage: Social media posts contain unstructured text, images, and multimedia content shared by users about the company's brand, products, and services. Social media monitoring tools can be used to collect and analyze this data in real-time. Sentiment analysis can gauge public sentiment towards the brand and identify emerging trends or issues. Social listening can help identify brand advocates, influencers, and potential crises that require immediate attention. Insights from social media data can inform brand positioning, marketing strategies, product launches, and customer engagement initiatives.\n",

        "Categorization: Structured data.\n",
        "Usage: Employee work schedules contain structured data about employee shifts, roles, and availability. This data can be used for workforce management, scheduling optimization, and labor cost control. Analyzing work schedules can help identify staffing gaps, overtime trends, and scheduling conflicts. Insights from employee work schedules can inform workforce planning, resource allocation, employee scheduling algorithms, and performance management strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, both structured and unstructured data sources play crucial roles in improving the company's business operations. Structured data provides quantitative insights into sales, operations, and workforce management, while unstructured data offers qualitative insights into customer sentiments, preferences, and brand perception. Integrating and analyzing both types of data can provide a comprehensive understanding of the business landscape and drive informed decision-making across various functions within the organization."
